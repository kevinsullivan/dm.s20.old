# SOURCE

We will occasionally distribute source code to you through this
directory. Do not change any files in this directory. Always copy
them to your mywork directory before opening them.

To start with, copy the single Lean file in this directory,
test_your_setup.lean, to yuor mywork folder. You can use drag and
drop, cut and paste, or even better yet, use command line commands in
a terminal. Then all you have to do is open it and check that after a
few seconds, it displays the right information. In the "messages"
panel on the right, it should tell you that 0 is a natural number,
0 : N.
